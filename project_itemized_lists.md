* Resources used
  * The biggest resource used was the [ThreeJS library](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), but a more detailed list is on the Github page.

## Cybots

* Resources used
  * Behavior Bricks Unity Asset

## Senior Design
* Description
  * A two-semester-long team project created during my senior year at ISU. It is a multi-effects pedal for musicians. It also enables users to record multiple tracks from multiple inputs.
* Role
  * Designer
  * Software Engineer (GUI)
* Skills / Knowledge Gained
  * Creating GUIs using the GTK library and related tools, such as Glade
  * More experience with the Linux operating system
  * Integration between software and hardware (embedded systems)
  * Sound processing
* Links to supporting docs
  * Here is our [Project Page](https://sddec19-15.sd.ece.iastate.edu/) on Iowa State University's website.
* Big picture contributions
  * I was mostly responsible for the design, implementation, and integration of the device's GUI with the rest of the project. There are GUIs on two separate screens, as well as the physical interface, which I also had a hand in designing.
  * The integration was the toughest part, since the GUI needed to react to changes on the physical UI (knobs, switches, etc.) and in response, reflect those changes for the back-end implementation.
