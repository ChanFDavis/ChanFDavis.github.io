# Yggdrasil Wars
## About
*Yggdrasil Wars: Day's of Our Knights* is a game that was created for a group project class by a four-person team of Computer Science and Software Engineering majors. This group was comprised of Jake K., Ashley Y., Andrew M., and myself, Chandler D. The project's development took place over a period of a semester and won the prestige of Second Best Project in the class.

*Yggdrasil Wars* is an online multiplayer game played from the top-down viewpoint where the player must defeat monsters to earn points. These monsters continuously spawn, at different intervals, from castles that are randomly placed upon the game's initialization. These creatures are common fantasy fare, including: bats, spiders, and goblins. Each enemy type has unique characteristics to spice up the gameplay.

 Upon starting the game player is able to pick from a number of classes: Knight, Cavalry, Barbarian, Mercenary, and Rogue. Just like the enemies, each of these classes have unique characteristics and abilities. The Cavalry is very fast; the Barbarian can grow in size; and more! There are also locked chests and an unlocking minigame that you will just have to play for yourself.

## More on Skills Gained
One of the biggest skills acquired during the development of this game, was experience with the Javascript language. Before working on this project, I was the only team member who had prior experience with the language. Even so, it was just as much of a learning experience for me as it was for the other team members. On top of the Javascript syntax, we also gained extensive experience with the P5js library. This library provided a simple API for implementing the visuals of the game: sprites, textures, collisions, etc. The library also provided an API for playing sound. 

Since none of us had implemented real-time online functionality before, we had to learn a lot to get the game's multiplayer working. For this task, we relied on Node JS, specifically the Express module. This incorporated the use of NPM and the concept of dependency management. One of the take-aways of this project was to start building online services with the online part in mind. We had initially decided to implement everything locally and port to online later; however, we had to refactor the code and structure entirely to work online.

Lastly, we learned how to use Git, as well as general source control concepts. Using this, we learning how to better work as part of a team. 

Due to the Node dependency, I am unable to directly host the project to this page. If you wish to try the game for yourself, head to the project's Github repository by clicking the green button to the right. You'll find all of the files necessary to host a local server and client to play the game.
